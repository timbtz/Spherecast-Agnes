Hackathon Use Case: Give our AI Supply Chain Manager ‘Agnes’ Raw
Material Superpowers
CPG companies regularly overpay because sourcing is fragmented. The same ingredient or
packaging component may be purchased by multiple companies, plants, or product lines without
anyone having full visibility into the combined demand. That means suppliers do not see the
true buying volume, orders are not consolidated, and buyers lose leverage on price, lead time,
and service levels. But consolidation is only valuable if the components are actually
substitutable and still compliant in the context of the end product.
This is where AI creates value: it can connect fragmented purchasing data, infer which materials
are functionally equivalent, verify whether quality and compliance requirements are still met, and
recommend sourcing decisions that are cheaper, more scalable, and operationally realistic.
At Spherecast, we think of this capability as Agnes: an AI Supply Chain Manager that helps
teams make better sourcing decisions by reasoning across fragmented supply chain data. This
hackathon invites participants to challenge our current approach and push that vision further.
In this hackathon challenge, students are invited to design and build an AI-powered
decision-support system for sourcing in the CPG industry. Teams will work on a realistic
problem faced by a company that centrally manages procurement intelligence and uses it to
support customers in the CPG space.
Given multiple normalized bill of materials (BOMs), existing supplier relationships, and
historical procurement decisions across several companies, teams must determine which
components are genuinely substitutable and which sourcing decisions can be consolidated. The
scope includes not only raw ingredients, but also packaging, labels, and filling-related
materials.
The challenge goes far beyond simple cost optimization. Teams must infer whether a cheaper or
more consolidated alternative still satisfies the quality and compliance requirements of the
finished product. This may require combining structured internal data with incomplete external
evidence such as supplier websites, product listings, certification databases, label
images, packaging text, public product pages, and regulatory references. A sourcing
recommendation is only valid if the system can justify that compliance and quality constraints
are still met.
The focus lies on making incomplete and messy data actionable: identifying functional
substitutes, inferring compliance-relevant requirements, and producing an explainable
sourcing proposal that balances supplier consolidation, cost, lead time, and practical
feasibility. There is no single correct answer. This is an intentionally open-ended challenge
centered on reasoning quality, trustworthiness, and business value.
Target Group
● Students interested in applying AI, data sourcing, and optimization
● Students with knowledge of LLMs, retrieval systems, agentic workflows, multimodal
methods, optimization, data sourcing, scraping
● Teams that enjoy solving open-ended, real-world problems with incomplete information
Core Challenge
● Identify functionally interchangeable components at the component level, including
ingredients, packaging, labels, and filling-related materials
● Infer which quality and compliance requirements a substitute must satisfy, based on
structured data and external evidence
● Produce an explainable sourcing recommendation with evidence trails and tradeoff
explanations across cost, supplier consolidation, and compliance
The Application to Be Built
● An internal AI decision-support application for consumer-industry sourcing
● A system that ingests organizer-provided BOM and supplier data and enriches it with
external information
● A solution that proposes likely substitute components and evaluates whether they are
acceptable in the context of the end product
● A reasoning layer that surfaces sources, evidence trails, and tradeoff explanations
● An optimization or recommendation layer that produces a consolidated sourcing
proposal per component category or product group
Data Provided
● Normalized BOM data
● Supplier data, including existing supplier-to-component mappings and commercial fields
such as price, lead time, country, and minimum order quantity
● Historical procurement decisions as partial ground truth that may inform reasoning,
but should not be copied blindly
● A Postgres database dump and a matching Python SQLAlchemy ORM
implementation as a starting point
Technology Setup
● The challenge is technologically agnostic
● Teams may use any models, frameworks, orchestration patterns, multimodal
approaches, or hosting stack
● External enrichment is strongly encouraged and will be necessary for strong results
● Participants are expected to decide for themselves how to retrieve, verify, structure,
and operationalize and reconstruct missing evidence
Deliverables
● A working prototype or technical decision-support system
● A presentation including:
○ Problem framing and business relevance
○ Data acquisition and enrichment strategy
○ Approach to substitution detection and compliance inference
○ Optimization / recommendation logic
○ Architectural decisions and model choices
○ Demonstration of the system
● A clear explanation of how the system handles uncertainty, evidence quality, and
tradeoffs
Judging Emphasis
● Practical usefulness and business relevance
● Quality of reasoning and evidence trails
● Trustworthiness and hallucination control
● Ability to source and operationalize missing external information
● Soundness of the substitution logic and compliance inference
● Quality and defensibility of the final sourcing proposal
● Creativity in showing how the system could scale and improve over time
● UI polish is not a priority
